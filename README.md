# PruebaTecnicaSofka 25 Questions
<h2>By Jose David Gonzalez Henao</h2>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>25 Questions is a game that will test your knowledge in differnt areas. The game has two modes of play:<br>
Console and Tkinter app, in the console app you will have to run it and it will request your mode of play. If you <br>
already have a created user you should provide the exact name that you saved your previous game otherwise the game will <br>
not run. Whereas if you use the new player option you the username provided should not be already on the database otherwise <br>
the game will not run. When you start the game the game throws you a random related to your level question with 4 options to get<br>
the correct option you should write exactly the same line that you think is correct. If you fail you restart the test,<br>
if you get the correct answer you advance. This process is repeated until you loose or until you answer 5 consecutive questions.<br>
The other mode of play is in a Tkinter app. When you run it it will prompt a window requesting you the same info as in the console app<br>
this app has the added filter that it requires the username to not have a comma so it doesn't interfere with the csv file. Then after <br>
the user is loged in succesfully the program prompts a question with 4 options, the user should select the option by clicking it and then confirm<br>
the selection by pushing the button "Submit", if the answer is correct you advence if it is not the game will show a game over<br>
window and you loose all the progress. The game finishes when you answer 5 questions in a row. In both cases the game automathicly saves<br>
if you get an answer right so if you close the window it will pick up right where you left. Meanwhile if you fail all your score is lost and<br>
you have to restart the game<br></p>
